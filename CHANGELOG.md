## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

Initial open-source production release of `skybouncer`: the sovereign, rule-driven automated moderation bouncer for AT Protocol and Bluesky.

### Added

- **Interaction Ingestion & Target Matching (`skybouncer::ingest`)**:
  - Live Jetstream event stream listener for protected account interactions.
  - Precision targeting for direct replies, thread root replies, mentions, and quotes.
  - Resilient WebSocket connection management with automatic reconnect.

- **Non-Followed Direct Interaction Gate (`skybouncer::classifier::gate`)**:
  - In-memory thread-safe `FollowGraph` keeping track of trusted follow relationships.
  - Dynamic follow/unfollow synchronization directly from the Jetstream firehose.
  - Sub-microsecond bypass for followed accounts and self-authored posts ($0 model cost, zero latency).

- **Pluggable Structured Classification Engine (`skybouncer::classifier`)**:
  - Trait-based `Classifier` contract delivering structured `Verdict` results (`Violation` vs `Permitted`).
  - `JevClassifier`: asynchronous client for Jev-like structured LLM decision endpoints (`JEV_API_BASE_URL`, `JEV_API_KEY`, `JEV_MODEL`).
  - `HeuristicClassifier`: regex and keyword fast-path pre-filter.
  - `MockClassifier`: deterministic offline classifier for integration testing.
  - Structured `RuleRubric` evaluator supporting Low, Medium, and High sensitivity thresholds.

- **Sovereign PDS Moderation Mutator & Deduplication (`skybouncer::pds`, `skybouncer::index`)**:
  - Auto-provisioning and synchronization of sovereign `app.bsky.graph.list` (`#modlist`).
  - DPoP-signed XRPC `createRecord` mutations for `app.bsky.graph.listitem` via `skybase` / `skyauth`.
  - Embedded SQLite audit history and deduplication cache to prevent duplicate evaluations or list items.
  - Support for unbanning and pardoning (`deleteRecord`).

- **Flexible Interaction Modes & Administration**:
  - Continuous daemon mode (`skybouncer daemon`).
  - Single-target manual dry-run audit CLI (`skybouncer audit`).
  - Web dashboard and REST API with live stats, audit log, and rule management (`skybouncer::web`).
  - Interactive bot command handler for real-time moderation adjustments via Bluesky mentions (`skybouncer::bot`).
  - Sovereign PDS configuration sync (`social.skybouncer.config` / list metadata).

- **Safety & Quality Standards**:
  - `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` crate-wide.
  - Strict compiler lint safety guard denying unwraps, expects, panics, and missing documentation.
  - Comprehensive unit, integration, and property-based test suites.
